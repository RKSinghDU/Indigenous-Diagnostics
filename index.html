• Low skill variety (3.2/10)
• Monotonous tasks
• High turnover intention

YOUR TASK (Groups of 4-5):
Using the Indigenous Diagnostic Worksheet:

1. What is Manufacturing's SVADHARMA (unique purpose)?
   Does current state align?

2. What is its PRAKRITI (innate nature/character)?

3. Is this the right KALA (timing) for intervention?

4. Map INTERCONNECTIONS - how does burnout ripple 
   through the whole Bharat Textiles system?

DELIVERABLE: 2-3 key diagnostic insights

STRUCTURAL INTERVENTIONS
OVERVIEW

Changing the Organizational Architecture
```

### SLIDE 11: WHAT ARE STRUCTURAL INTERVENTIONS?

**Layout:** Title + Definition + Types

**Title:** Structural Interventions in OD

**Content:**
```
DEFINITION:
Interventions that change the FORMAL organizational design—
hierarchy, roles, departments, processes, work design

FOUR MAIN TYPES:

1. RESTRUCTURING
   • Changing hierarchy (flatten/add layers)
   • Departmentation (functional → matrix)
   • Reporting relationships

2. DOWNSIZING / RIGHTSIZING
   • Reducing organizational size
   • Streamlining operations

3. REENGINEERING
   • Process redesign (eliminate non-value steps)
   • Technology integration

4. WORK DESIGN ◄── Today's Focus
   • Job redesign (top-down)
   • Job crafting (bottom-up)
```

**Visual:** Icons for each intervention type

### SLIDE 12: GANDHIAN PERSPECTIVE ON STRUCTURE

**Layout:** Title + Quote + Application

**Title:** Decentralization Principle (Gandhian OD)

**Content:**
```
"True democracy or the Swaraj of the masses can never come 
through untruthful and violent means... The structure of 
world federation can be raised only on a foundation of 
non-violence, and violence will have to be totally abjured 
from world affairs."
                                    — Gandhi (Gram Swarajya)

OD APPLICATION:

Structural interventions can:
✓ EMPOWER (decentralize, flatten hierarchy, increase autonomy)
✗ CENTRALIZE (increase control, reduce employee agency)

CRITICAL QUESTION:
Does this structural change align with SWARAJ 
(self-governance) and SARVODAYA (welfare of all)?
```

**Design notes:** Quote in italics, highlighted application

3 FORMS OF JOB CRAFTING:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. TASK CRAFTING                            │
│ Changing job boundaries, tasks added/removed│

│ Example: Nurse adds patient education to    │
│ routine care duties                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. RELATIONAL CRAFTING                      │
│ Changing who you interact with and how      │
│                                             │
│ Example: Manufacturing worker becomes       │
│ informal mentor to new employees            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. COGNITIVE CRAFTING                       │
│ Changing how you perceive/frame your work   │
│                                             │

### SLIDE 18: GANDHIAN INTEGRATION

**Layout:** Title + Reflective questions

**Title:** Which Approach Aligns with Gandhian Principles?

**Content:**
```
SARVODAYA (Welfare of All)
• Job Redesign: Benefits all in role (standardized)
• Job Crafting: Benefits individual (personalized)
→ Which ensures universal benefit?

SWARAJ (Self-Governance)
• Job Redesign: Management decides
• Job Crafting: Employee decides
→ Which honors self-determination?

TRUSTEESHIP
• Job Redesign: Management as stewards improving work
• Job Crafting: Employees as stewards of their own meaning
→ Different manifestations of stewardship?

TENSION:
Job redesign can be PATERNALISTIC
Job crafting embodies SWARAJ but may lack structure

SYNTHESIS: Use BOTH strategically!
```

**Design notes:** Use saffron highlights for Gandhian terms

### SLIDE 19: ACTIVITY 2 - DESIGN INTERVENTIONS

**Layout:** Title + Instructions

**Title:** Apply to Bharat Textiles Manufacturing (10 min)

**Content:**
```
PROBLEM RECAP:
Manufacturing department - 68% high burnout, low skill 
variety (3.2/10), monotonous tasks, high turnover

YOUR TASK (Same Groups):
Using Student Worksheet, design interventions:

PART A: JOB REDESIGN APPROACH
How would you redesign Manufacturing jobs using the 
5 Job Characteristics?
- Increase skill variety how?
- Increase autonomy how?
- Increase feedback how?

PART B: JOB CRAFTING APPROACH
How would you ENABLE employees to craft their jobs?
- What permissions needed?
- What support structures?

PART C: INTEGRATION
Which approach aligns better with Gandhian Sarvodaya 
and Swaraj? Can you combine both?

PART D: INDIGENOUS LENS
How does seeing this through SVADHARMA (each worker's 
unique purpose) change the intervention?
```

### SLIDE 20: DEBRIEF QUESTIONS (SOCRATIC)

**Layout:** Title + Guiding questions

**Title:** Let's Synthesize Your Insights

**Content:**
```
For the class to discuss:

1. IMPLEMENTATION
   • Which approach is faster? More sustainable?
   • What are tradeoffs?

2. EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE
   • Job redesign: "They changed my job"
   • Job crafting: "I changed my job"
   • Which creates more ownership?

3. GANDHIAN TENSION
   • Is job redesign paternalistic?
   • Can job crafting work without some structure?
   • How to balance SARVODAYA (welfare of all) 
     with individual crafting?

4. INDIGENOUS WISDOM
   • Does SVADHARMA lens reveal insights that 
     Job Characteristics Model misses?
   • What about KALA (timing) - is Manufacturing 
     ready for bottom-up job crafting?

5. SYSTEMS THINKING
   • If we redesign Manufacturing jobs, what 
     ripple effects across Bharat Textiles?
```

**Presenter notes:** Use Socratic method - don't answer, guide students to insights

(Other options: Human Process, Technostructural, HR, Strategic)

STEP 3: CHOOSE SPECIFIC STRUCTURAL INTERVENTION
↓
Work design issues → Job Redesign or Job Crafting

STEP 4: IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
↓
Top-down (Job Redesign) vs. Bottom-up (Job Crafting)

### SLIDE 23: APPLICATION TO SIMULATION

**Layout:** Title + Checklist

**Title:** In Bharat Textiles Simulation Round 2...

**Content:**
```
When selecting STRUCTURAL INTERVENTIONS, ask:

☑ INDIGENOUS DIAGNOSTIC
  Does this honor organizational SVADHARMA?
  What's the PRAKRITI (nature) of this department?

☑ JOB CHARACTERISTICS
  Does it increase skill variety, autonomy, feedback?
  Will it create meaningfulness and ownership?

☑ EMPLOYEE AGENCY
  Can we enable JOB CRAFTING alongside redesign?
  Are we empowering or controlling?

☑ GANDHIAN ALIGNMENT
  Does it serve SARVODAYA (welfare of all)?
  Does it honor SWARAJ (self-governance)?
  Are we stewards (TRUSTEESHIP) of employees?

☑ SYSTEMS THINKING
  What are ripple effects across departments?
  How does this affect organizational wholeness?

REMEMBER: Fastest intervention ≠ Best intervention
```
